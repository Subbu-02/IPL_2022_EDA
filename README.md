# IPL 2022 Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This is a project that I worked on to put my Data Analysis skills to test. I have used the IPL dataset from Kaggle to perform the analysis. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/ipl-player-performance-dataset?rvi=1). I have picked the runs data and approached the data from a batting perspective. I have used Python and its libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to perform the analysis. I have also used Plotly to create interactive plots. The project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Building Insights
